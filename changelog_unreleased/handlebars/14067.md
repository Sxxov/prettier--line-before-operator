#### Group params in opening block statements (#14067 by @jamescdavis)

This is a follow-up to #13930 to establish wrapping consistency between opening block statements and else blocks by
grouping params in opening blocks. This causes params to break to a new line together and not be split across lines
unless the length of params exceeds the print width. This also updates the else block wrapping to behave exactly the
same as opening blocks.
